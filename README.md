# workspaces

launch, navigate, and save workspaces

Workspaces is used to quickly launch groups of related tabs (workspaces).

For example, a work category may have an email service, Git provider, and company documentation site. Rather than navigating to these URLs manually, Workspaces can launch them at the same time.
